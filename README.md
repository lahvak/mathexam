#mathexam, a LaTeX package for typesetting exams.

##What's this nonsense?

This package can help you typeset exams (mostly in mathematics and related
disciplines where students are required to show their calculations followed by
one or more short answers). It provides commands for inclusion of space for
calculations, as well as commands for automatic creation of ``answer spaces''.
In addition, the package will automatically create page headers and footers,
and will let you include instructions and space for students to put their
name.  

I wrote it because all the (otherwise excellent) exam typesetting packages on
CTAN were too complicated for my needs. I wanted something very simple that
would work with existing document classes.

You can also find it on CTAN at https://www.ctan.org/pkg/mathexam
